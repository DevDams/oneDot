# What is one Dot
one Ddot is a game build with the framework #Vue.js, it's not something really difficult.
Everything is simple in the files of the project, the only thing you need is a little knowledge of Vue,
and I'm sure you got it, right ? So...

# How to play
Once you end up with the installation, it's simple to play

1. Enter your name or a pseudo in the form and hit "Jouer" (That means play in french)
2. You have 10 secondes to earn as many points as possible
3. At the end of the 10 secondes, the game will stop and you will see the number of points you win

# Be careful
I said the game is easy but there are pitfalls

- When you don't click on the dot and you click somewhere else you loose 1 point
- Click on the RED dot by pressing 'alt' on your keyboard, makes you win 2 points
- Click on the RED dot without pressing 'alt' on your keyboard, and you will win just 1 point
## The position of the dot change when you don't click on it after 1 seconde

# Help
If you find some bug or want to help me make this game more fun, DO IT WITHOUT HESITATION !!!
